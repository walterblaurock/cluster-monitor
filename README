ClusterMonitor
==============

ClusterMonitor monitors a cluster of computers and determines, based on load,
when machines can be taken online or brought offline. This is particularly
useful when dealing with cloud applications where servers can be rented hourly
and excess server capacity is a waste of money.

Usage
-----

In order to ensure compatability with a number of systems, all interactions with
the servers and their hosts (in the case of VM's or cloud computing) are
abstracted out. In order for ClusterMonitor to work for you, you must implement
ClusterInterface and provide the necessary functionality.
