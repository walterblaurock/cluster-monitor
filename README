ClusterMonitor
==============

ClusterMonitor monitors a cluster of computers and determines, based on available system metrics, when machines be taken online or brought offline. This is particulary useful when dealing with cloud applications where servers can be rented hourly and excess server capacity is a waste of money.

Usage
-----

In order to ensure capatability with a wide range of setups, the actual interactions with the physical machines / VMMs / providers are abstracted out. The client application must implement a number of methods such as startServer() and stopServer() in order to allow the ClusterMonitor to control physical machines.
